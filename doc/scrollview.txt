|nvim-scrollview| is a plugin that displays (non-interactive) scrollbars.
The plugin is customizable (see |scrollview-configuration|).

============================================================================
1. Requirements                            *scrollview-requirements*

* `nvim>=0.5`

============================================================================
2. Installation                            *scrollview-installation*

Use |packages| or one of the various package managers.

============================================================================
3. Usage                                   *scrollview-usage*

* |nvim-scrollview| works automatically, displaying (non-interactive)
  scrollbars.
* The *:ScrollViewDisable* command disables scrollbars.
* The *:ScrollViewEnable* command enables scrollbars. This is only necessary
  if scrollbars have previously been disabled.
* The *:ScrollViewRefresh* command refreshes the scrollbars. This is relevant
  when the scrollbars are out-of-sync, which can occur e.g., as a result of
  some window arrangement actions (see |scrollview-issues|).

============================================================================
4. Configuration                           *scrollview-configuration*

The following variables can be used to customize the behavior of
|nvim-scrollview|. Variables can be set at the 1) window, 2) tab, 3) buffer,
and/or 4) global scope, with that order of precedence (i.e., window variables
have the highest precedence, and global variables have the lowest).

`Variable`                                `Default`
  Description                             Info
-------------                           -------

*scrollview_on_startup*                   `1`
  Specifies whether scrollbars are        Considered only at global scope
  enabled on startup
*scrollview_excluded_filetypes*           `[]`
  Optional file types for which
  scrollbars should not be displayed
*scrollview_current_only*                 `0`
  Specifies whether scrollbars should     Considered only at tab and global
  only be displayed in the current        scopes
  window
*scrollview_winblend*                     `50`
  Specifies the level of transparency     An integer between 0 (opaque) and
  for scrollbars                          100 (transparent)
*scrollview_base*                         `'right'`
  Specifies where the scrollbar is        `'left'` or `'right'` for corresponding
  anchored                                window edges, or `'buffer'` for buffer
*scrollview_column*                       `1`
  Specifies the scrollbar column          An integer greater than or equal
  (relative to |scrollview_base|)           to 1


The variables can be customized in your |init.vim|, as shown in the following
example.
 >
	let g:scrollview_excluded_filetypes = ['nerdtree']
	let g:scrollview_current_only = 1
	let g:scrollview_winblend = 75
	" Position the scrollbar at the 80th character of the buffer
	let g:scrollview_base = 'buffer'
	let g:scrollview_column = 80

Color Customization ~
                                           *scrollview-color-customization*
The following highlight group can be configured to change |nvim-scrollview|'s
colors.

Name         Default   Description
----         -------   -----------
`ScrollView`   `Visual`    Color for the scrollbar

The highlight groups can be customized in your |init.vim|, as shown in the
following example.
 >
	" Link ScrollView highlight to Pmenu highlight
	highlight link ScrollView Pmenu

	" Specify custom highlighting for ScrollView
	highlight ScrollView ctermbg=159 guibg=LightCyan

5. Issues                                  *scrollview-issues*

* Scrollbars become out-of-sync after window arrangement actions that are not
  followed by a scroll event. For example, this can be seen by starting `nvim`,
  issuing |:help|, then typing `<ctrl-w>J` to move the help window to the
  bottom of the screen. This could be resolved if there was an event that is
  triggered by the window arrangement actions. `:ScrollViewRefresh`, or
  scrolling can be used to refresh the scrollbars.
* Scrollbars become out-of-sync when the mouse wheel is used to scroll a
  non-current window. This is because the WinScrolled event only corresponds
  to the current window. The scrollbars can be refreshed with
  `:ScrollViewRefresh`, scrolling, or by changing the current window.
* Scrollbar positions and sizes do not account for folds.
